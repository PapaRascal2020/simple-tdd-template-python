# A simple enviroment for Python3 TDD 

A simple skeleton project to test Python code using pytest

## First Steps

* Download/Clone the repository

I have included a simple math test just to show its working.
This is what I use for my Python3 TDD.

## Create your own tests. 

For the test portion:

* Create a new folder within tests directory like 'test_{0}'
* Create an empty __init__.py script in the folder
* Create 'test_{0}.py'

Replace {0} with your class name

For the class portion:

* CD into src directory
* Create an empty __init__.py script in the folder
* Create '{0}.py'

Replace {0} with your test name

Reference the class using an import in your test_{0}.py script

-- I have included an example to help.

## Run tests
 * Open root folder in the terminal/command prompt
 * RUN python -m pytest tests

## Requirements

* Python3
* pytest (Can be installed by opening terminal/command prompt and typing "pip install pytest")
